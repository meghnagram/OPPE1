#Sum of squares and absolute difference of squares
#Write a function sum_squares_abs_diff_squares that takes two integer inputs, a and b, and returns a tuple with:

   # 1. The sum of the squares of a and b.

    #2. The absolute difference of the squares of a and b.

#NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

#Example
#Given the inputs a = 3 and b = 4:

#Explanation

    #• The sum of squares would be 9 + 16 = 25.

    #• The absolute difference of squares would be |9 - 16| = 7.

#So, sum_squares_abs_diff_squares(3, 4) should return (25, 7).
